# Data analytics ethics triage - output

Thank you for completing the triage process. Your answers are available [here][triage-output]. In summary:

- You are developing a tool similar to those deployed in your local authority before. However, you only have limited evidence of the effectiveness of previous tools.
- The tool will be used by frontline social workers, who have previous experience using similar tools. You have evidence that the frontline social workers had a positive experience using those tools.
- The tool will require highly sensitive data about children and families.
- There has not been an assessment of whether similar tools deployed in the past have led to algorithmic bias.

Based on this, you should pay close attention to the following themes through the guidance:
