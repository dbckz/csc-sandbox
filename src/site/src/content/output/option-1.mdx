# Data analytics ethics triage - output

Thank you for completing the triage process. Your answers are available [here][triage-output]. In summary:

- You are developing a tool similar to those deployed in your local authority before. However, you only have limited evidence of the effectiveness of previous tools.
- The tool will be used by frontline social workers, who have previous experience using similar tools. You have evidence that the frontline social workers had a positive experience using those tools.
- The tool will require highly sensitive data about children and families.
- There has not been an assessment of whether similar tools deployed in the past have led to algorithmic bias.

Based on this, you should pay close attention to the following themes through the guidance:

| Key theme              | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Link to explainer                                    |

| Evaluation and testing | As there is only limited evidence of the effectiveness of similar tools deployed previously, you should prioritise evaluating and testing the performance of the tool to ensure it meets your objectives.                               | [https://gov.uk/cdei/csc/evaluation][evaluation]     |
| Data use and sharing   | As the tool will require highly sensitive data and children and families, you must ensure this data is collected, used, and shared so as to respect the rights of individuals, and minimise the risk of data being breached or misused. | [https://gov.uk/cdei/csc/data-use][data-use]         |
| Bias                   | As there has not been an assessment of algorithmic bias in previously deployed tools, you should prioritise carrying out such an assessment for your tool.                                                                              | [https://gov.uk/cdei/csc/bias][bias]                 |
| Data quality           | Data quality will directly affect the performance and biases of the tool. Data quality may therefore need to be prioritised in order to effectively evaluate the tool's performance and mitigate issues of algorithmic bias.            | [https://gov.uk/cdei/csc/data-quality][data-quality] |
