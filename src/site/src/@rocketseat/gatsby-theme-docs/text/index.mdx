# Data analytics ethics triage

This site is home to a [data analytics ethics triage tool](/ethics-triage), intended to be used as part of [CDEI/DfE]'s [ethics guidance for data analytics in children's social care][ethics-guidance].

The triage is an online self-assessment tool which can help you understand the different risk factors associated with your use case and proposed solution. The triage poses a series of questions about these factors, and recommends that you pay particular attention to specific 'explainer' themes in the guidance in order to mitigate risk.

## What you need to know

The ethics triage should be used after completing the _Exploratory_, _Problem Identification_, and _Choosing a Data Analytics Solution_ stages of the guidance. Completing these stages fully should ensure you have all the information required to complete the ethics triage.

Concretely, you should understand the following:

- What problem your proposed data analytics solution is intending to solve
- What the intended value of your use case is, who is likely to benefit, and how
- What type of data analytics (descriptive, diagnostic or predictive) you will use
- Details of where similar tools have been deployed in the past
- Who will be directly using the tool and who will be directly affected by it
- Your organisational data maturity
- What datasets may be needed to develop the tool

You can then proceed to the [ethics triage](/ethics-triage).
